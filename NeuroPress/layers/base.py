Module: base

This module defines the `BaseQuantizedLayer` abstract base class, which serves as a foundational
interface for quantized layers in neural network models. Classes inheriting from `BaseQuantizedLayer`
are required to implement methods for training and inference forward passes, as well as methods
to freeze and unfreeze the layer for deployment and training purposes, respectively.

    Abstract Base Class for Quantized Neural Network Layers.

    The `BaseQuantizedLayer` class defines a standardized interface for quantized layers within
    neural network models. It inherits from Python's `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) and PyTorch's
    `nn.Module`, enforcing the implementation of essential methods required for both training
    and inference phases, as well as methods to manage the layer's quantization state.
